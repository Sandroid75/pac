This code was made by Sandroid75 to illustrate various C language powers.
My recommendations for developing robust C code are:
 - first of all read The C Programming Language: ANSI C Version by K&R (C);
 - after read K&R keep always in mind rules and methods;
 - one of the most characteristics and powers of the C is the pointers;
 - pointers are very helpfull and flexibile to write efficient code;
 - pointers can be dangerous for stable code if you forget the rules;
 - if you use pointers for list of datas don't forget to reserve memory;
 - if you use pointers for list of datas don't forget to release memory;
 - write well-formatted code;
 - only good formatted code makes the code readable;
 - good formatting code reduces the risk of errors;
 - good formatting code facilitates the debugging;
 - good formatting code facilitates the maintenences;
 - good formatting code facilitates future implementantions;
 - commenting the code is another good and necessary practice;
 - commenting the code means understanding what you are doing;
 - commenting the code means understanding what you have done;
 - commenting the code is not a waste of time;
 - at the last but not least, remember rules and methods.
